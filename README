Bacon
==========
Use this command line tool to download CyanogenMod ROMs for any CM-supported
Android device.

Bacon will probably currently only build and run properly on Linux machines,
but aims to be cross-platform very soon.



Note about Arch Linux
=====================
If you are an Arch Linux user, the latest version of bacon can always be
found in the Arch User Repository (AUR).



Building
============
First, obtain the latest source with Git:
    git clone git://github.com/natediddy/bacon.git bacon

Change to the source directory:
    cd bacon

Build and install:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
    make
    # And optionally to install on your system:
    sudo make install

To build for installation with `pacman' (Arch Linux only):
    git clone git://github.com/natediddy/bacon.git bacon
    cd bacon/linux/arch
    makepkg
    sudo pacman -U bacon-${pkgver}-${pkgrel}-${arch}.pkg.tar.xz

More than one DEVICE can be given, but only ONE option per DEVICE list.

For more usage information, view the man page after installing with:
