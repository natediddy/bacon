bacon
---------

Use this command line tool to download CyanogenMod ROMs for any CM-supported
Android device.

Bacon will probably currently only build and run properly on Linux machines,
but aims to be cross-platform very soon.

Building:
---------
At the moment, bacon includes 2 methods of compiling: Autotools and CMake.

First, obtain the latest source with Git:
    git clone git://github.com/natediddy/bacon.git bacon
Change to the source directory:
    cd bacon
Build using Autotools:
    ./configure
    make
    # Or optionally to install on your system:
    sudo make install
Build using CMake (ensure CMake is installed on your system first!):
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    # Or optionally to install on your system:
    sudo make install

Two separate scripts are also provided to automate both of the methods above.
They are 'buildauto' and 'buildcmake'. You can run these from the source
directory and (optionally) provide 'make' with options when invoking either
one, like so:
    ./buildauto prefix=$HOME install
    sudo ./buildcmake install

Usage:
---------
bacon [-S|-s|-n|-r|-d|-h|-v] DEVICE ...

Options:
  -S, --show               show latest builds for DEVICE(s), do not download
  -s, --stable             download latest stable build for DEVICE(s)
  -n, --nightly            download latest nightly build for DEVICE(s)
  -r, --release-candidate  download latest release candidate for DEVICE(s)
  -d, --devices            display all available DEVICEs and exit
  -u, --update-devices     update the current DEVICE list and exit
  -h, -?, --help           display this message and exit
  -v, --version            display version information and exit

More than 1 DEVICE can be given: but only 1 option per DEVICE-list
