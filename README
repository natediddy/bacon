bacon
---------

Use this command line tool to download CyanogenMod ROMs for any CM-supported
Android device.

Bacon will probably currently only build and run properly on Linux machines,
but aims to be cross-platform very soon.

Building:
---------
git clone git://github.com/natediddy/bacon.git bacon
cd bacon
make && sudo make install

Use `bacon --help' for instructions on how to use.
