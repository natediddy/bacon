Bacon

Use this command line tool to download CyanogenMod ROMs for any CM-supported
Android device.

Bacon will probably currently only build and run properly on Linux machines,
but aims to be cross-platform very soon.

=====================
If you are an Arch Linux user, the latest version of bacon can be always be
found in the Arch User Repository (AUR).
